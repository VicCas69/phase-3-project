# phase-3-project

# Introduction

This project is ineteded to provide users the ability to add gifts to a Christmas gift list being display in the home page. Also, users can create new recipients and associate him/her to a gift.

# Gifts List 

At the top of the page we can find a display of the list of gifts already created (if any), each one with their respective "X" and "✏️" buttons (one for deleting a gift and one for updating a gift). 

# Gift form 

Under the gift list there is a "Add a new gift" form where users can create a new gift and be added to the database. Once submitted, the new gift will appear at the end of the gift list.

# Relative/recipient list

The next element being displayed in our application is the relative/recipient list. This is a list of all recipient stored in the database. Each recipient posses a "x" button in case the user wants to delete any of them.

# Relative/recipient form

Usually people only give presents to their relatives for Christmas. However, we all have loved ones that are not neccesarily related to us so we may want to show them our feelings by also giving them presents. Users have the ability to add a new user by submitting the relative form where it includes the name of the recipient and the relationship with the user. Once submitted, the new recepient will be display at the end of the the relative/recipient list
